Problem description :

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.


Solution 1:
If the number can  not be divide by 2, it must not be the power of 2. If it can, then divide 2 to replace itself


Solution 2:

Fisrtly the number must be larger than zero, secondly  the number of 1 in its binary must be only one!

condition: num >0 && (num & (num-1))==0


tips:
Be careful of the number 0.
