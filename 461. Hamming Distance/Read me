Problem description :

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.


Solution:
Use bit manipulation to solve the problem. Use exclusive or(^) to find the different bit of them ,then tranfer the value to binary to count the number of different bit.

tips:
also can use move bit to count the number.
 while(xor!=0) {
            count+= xor & 1;
            xor >>= 1;
        }
        r
