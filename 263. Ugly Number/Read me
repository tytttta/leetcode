Problem description :

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.


Solution:
if the num can be devided by 2,3,5 then use the num to divide 2,3,5 to get the divided value until the number is equal to 1 then it will be a ugly num. 
if not, then the number is not ugly number.

tips:
Be careful that the number 0 is not ugly number,and the number 1 is ugly number . And  when the number is excced than the largest number 
of int(2147483648), how to get the right result.
