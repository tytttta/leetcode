Problem description :

Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example:
Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3.



Solution:
Use bit manipulation to calculate the result, a&b get the carry, and a^b find the different bit. Then, we shift carry one position left and assign it to b, b = 0010. Iterate until there is no carry (or b == 0)
