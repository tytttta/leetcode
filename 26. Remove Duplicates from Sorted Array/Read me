Problem description :

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.


Solution:
Use two pointer to point the second position(index) and the first different number, if find the different number ,then copy it to the second position and move forward both pointer. At last return the index pointer.
