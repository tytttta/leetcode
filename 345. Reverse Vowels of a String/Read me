Problem description :

Write a function that takes a string as input and reverse only the vowels of a string.

Example 1:
Given s = "hello", return "holle".

Example 2:
Given s = "leetcode", return "leotcede".


Solution:
Traverse all the char from the begining to the end in the string , find the first and the last vowels in the string then swap it,
 and then the second and last second.

tips:
Be careful that the uppercase of "aoeiu" are also vowels.
Can optimize this algorithm?
