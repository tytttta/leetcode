Problem description :

You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.


Solution:
Use a stack to store all the elements in nums2, and if the next stored element is greater than the peek number in the stack, put the peek element and the next element into a map util find a greater number than the stored number, and the next greater number of these peek number is the stored number.

for example :nums1=[1,2,3], nums2=[3,2,1,4], the order of storing is 3,2,1,when store the 4, number 3,2,1 will pop and be stored in the map and the next greater number of 3,2,1 is 4.

tips:
In  nums1 the element 4's index is 2 in nums2 and the next greater number is -1.  The same reason that the 1' next greater number is 3.
