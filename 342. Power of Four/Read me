Problem description :

Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example:
Given num = 16, return true. Given num = 5, return false.

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

Solution:
Notice that the number that is power of 4 is suit for the regulation: 
1. is the power of 2(make sure that the number of 1 is one)
2. the position of 1(binary) is the odd.for example :100, 10000

Use manipulate to solve this problem.
 (num & (num-1))==0 presents that only one 1 in its binary.
 (num  & 0x55555555)=!=0 presents the position of 1 is the odd.

tips:
0x55555555=1010101010101010101010101010101
