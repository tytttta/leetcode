Problem description :

Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.


Solution:

This is a dynamic program problem. Find the sub problem to get the result. Use an array res[] to represent the max sum of former i element. If it is above 0, add the res[i+1], else make it to 0.

tips:
Be careful that all the element is negative.
